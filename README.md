## Dev version system

The `dev` branch is the shared Development → Beta → RC testing line. Human-facing versions use a compact suffix while Android `versionCode` remains a strictly increasing install/update number.

- Normal development: `v1.1-a1`, `v1.1-a2`, `v1.1-b1`, `v1.1-rc1`
- Hotfix development: `v1.1-hf1-a1`, `v1.1-hf1-a2`, `v1.1-hf1-rc1`
- Next hotfix train: `v1.1-hf2-a1`
- Stable promotion may drop the dev suffix and use the stable branch release version.
- Current dev build: `v1.1-hf2-a1` / Android versionCode `100000105`.

## HCF Notifications home-screen widget

App Settings → Home-screen Widget now uses the same native HCF subsettings UI as the other App Settings categories. Widget Appearance, Notification Preview, Automatic Refresh, and Tap Behavior are standard expandable settings panels; the widget gear button deep-links to this same section.

The current dev line includes the resizable **HCF Notifications** Android App Widget. It displays the cached signed-in forum unread count from `hcf_app`, updates when the notification/session preferences change, and provides quick actions for Forum, Notifications, Reload, and App Settings. Widget rendering performs no direct network requests; Reload delegates to the existing HCF notification sync service and then refreshes the cached widget UI.

App Settings includes a root-level **Home-screen Widget** category. **Follow HCF app theme** is enabled by default, so the widget explicitly uses HCF's resolved Light, Dark, or AMOLED palette instead of allowing the launcher/phone theme to override its colors. **Show connected @username** and **Show unread count** are enabled by default. Additional controls include **Compact widget mode**, **Show last updated time**, and a **Default widget tap** chooser for Forum, Notifications, or App Settings. Identity, theme, content, layout, and action preference changes refresh existing widget instances automatically, and the category includes a manual **Refresh Home-screen Widget** action. While HCF live/background notification sync is active, every successful forum notification sync now immediately redraws placed widgets and records the actual sync time, so widget state tracks the existing adaptive notification loop instead of waiting for the launcher periodic update. The launcher schedule remains only a fallback, and no second widget-only network poller is created. The user-selected widget controls are included in HCF settings transfer/backup data.

## Beta/DEV v2 signing line

- Key alias: `hcf-beta-v2`
- Expected signer SHA-256: `93:D4:9B:F9:A8:77:C7:CF:B1:B3:7F:90:64:BD:95:5C:D6:7B:D7:DD:8D:B7:3A:9E:3F:76:6B:59:C4:BC:CE:63`
- APK signing: v1 + v2 + v3 + v4 (`.idsig` sidecar)

`build-release.sh` rejects a different signing certificate to protect in-place Beta/Dev updates. The updater verifies the exact APK SHA-256 as well as package name, versionCode, and signing-certificate lineage. If a release intentionally replaces an APK without changing versionCode, a changed SHA-256 identifies it as a same-version revision; an identical hash is treated as already installed.

## Repository layout

This branch is Android-only and intentionally minimal.

`source code/` contains only active Android build/runtime inputs:

- `AndroidManifest.xml` — package, version, permissions, components, and App Link declarations.
- `src/` — seven consolidated Java subsystem sources: `HcfCore`, `HcfForum`, `HcfUI`,
  `HcfNotifications`, `HcfUpdates`, `HcfPlatform`, plus the home-screen `HcfWidget` provider.
- `res/` — Android resources and launcher assets.
- `assets/` — bundled runtime assets.
- `build-release.sh` — local compile, package, align, and signing script.

Historical patch notes, old test-build notes, duplicate branding, deployment helper copies, temporary artifacts, and iOS files are intentionally excluded from the active `dev` branch.

Only the two active read-only GitHub Actions workflows and their release-verification scripts are retained. Generated trigger/output logs, one-time source-patching scripts, and unreferenced Android drawables are excluded.

## Release gates

The generic Dev release workflow compiles the complete Java/resource source, packages and aligns an unsigned CI APK, verifies package/version identity, checks the approved three-tile HCF Alerts UI, and rejects decompiler stubs or missing same-version SHA-256 update protections. Production signing remains local so the Beta private key is never stored in GitHub Actions.

The shared Stable + Dev Digital Asset Links source is [`configs/app-links/assetlinks.json`](./configs/app-links/assetlinks.json). Its canonical deployment source is the `main`-branch path `configs/app-links/assetlinks.json`; this Dev release does not modify or rebuild the Stable app.

Individual authenticated forum message notifications can expose Android inline **Reply** and **Mark as read** when the Flarum payload contains a resolvable server notification/conversation target. The Logs & Diagnostics screen records only sanitized action state/status metadata and never stores notification message or inline-reply content.

## HCF ban system

The current dev build uses a backend-free manual moderation design:

- Public IP lookup: ipify with IPinfo fallback.
- Signed-in sessions: Discord receives a user JSON observation.
- Signed-out sessions: Discord receives a guest JSON observation.
- Discord attachments include the raw IP for private moderation and a SHA-256 IP key for manual ban uplink.
- The public runtime ban list is `main/configs/ban-list.json`.
- Username bans use lowercase normalized username keys.
- Network bans use SHA-256 IP keys; raw IP addresses are not published in the public list.
- The native startup gate fails open if the public ban list cannot be reached.

The release workflow requires a GitHub Actions repository secret named `DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL`. It generates `HcfDiscordSecret.java` only inside the temporary Actions checkout, AES-encrypts the webhook value for the APK, and checks that the plaintext Discord webhook URL is not present in DEX strings. The generated file is ignored by Git and must never be committed.

APK-side encryption is an obfuscation layer rather than a trusted secret store because the app must be able to decrypt its own webhook credential. Rotate the webhook if it is exposed. Do not put the webhook, passwords, cookies, auth tokens, GitHub tokens, or service-account credentials in source or public configuration.


## Google Play and legacy/sideload builds

The `dev` branch supports two distribution modes:

- **Google Play (default):** uses `source code/AndroidManifest.xml`, scheduled
  notification sync, and Google Play for app installation and updates.
- **Legacy / sideload:** build with `HCF_LEGACY_SYSTEM=1` to use
  `source code/AndroidManifest.legacy.xml`. This retains the historical
  foreground live-notification service, direct battery-exemption request, and
  verified APK updater.

Legacy builds receive a `-Legacy.apk` suffix. Do not upload a Legacy APK to Google Play.


### Play Store update availability

Google Play builds use Google's official Play In-App Updates API
(`com.google.android.play:app-update:2.1.0`) to query the Play Store for the
installed account and release track. App Settings shows **Google Play Update Available**
when Play reports a newer build and otherwise shows that the installed build is up to
date. The legacy/sideload build continues to use the existing verified GitHub APK updater.
